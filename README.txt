Scope:
Create a message generator. For this project I will make the output telling me what I want to play in classic wow, including the race and class.
First, I will have it randomly pick a race to play. Then, I will have it pick the class, as class is restricted based on race.
I want to try and do this using objects, I will have each race as an object and the classes as properties.

For example, I will have the object choice with property race in an array, choice.race[undead,orc,troll,tauren,human,gnome,dwarf,night elf].
Each of those race properties will have a property class array that lists all the classes

Program will randomly pick an array number for race, then class. There would be an easier way to do this as the choices are very limited, but I want more experience with how the objects work

Output will be a simple "You will play a "race" "class".
